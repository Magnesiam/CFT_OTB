# Robust Tracking of Vessels in Oceanographic Airborne Images

The code in this repository was used to generate the results of a benchmark of general purpose tracking algorithms on the maritime setting using airborne imagery.

We also present a new approach which is based on KCF [1] tracker and blob analysis. The evaluations are done either with CNN [2] or HOG [3] features.
